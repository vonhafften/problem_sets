## Problem 1

A risk-neutral principal hires an agent to work on a project, offering a wage of $w$. The agent exerts effort $e$. The agent’s utility function is $v(w,e) =\sqrt w-g(e)$, where $g(e)$ is the disutility associated with effort $e$. The agent can choose one of two possible effort levels, $e_1$ or $e_2$, with associated disutility levels $g(e_1) = 1$ and $g(e_2) =\frac{1}{2}$. If the agent chooses effort level $e_1$, the project yields an output of 8 for the principal with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and 0 with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. If he chooses $e_2$, the project yields an output of 8 with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ and 0 with probability $\frac{3}{4}$. The agent’s reservation utility is 0.

(a) Suppose the effort level chosen by the agent is observable by the principal. A wage contract then specifies an effort level ($e_1$ or $e_2$) and an output-contingent wage schedule $\{w_H,w_L\}$. Here $w_H$ is the wage paid if the project yields 8, and $w_L$ is the wage paid if the project yields 0. If effort is observable, it is optimal for the principal to choose a fixed wage contract (that is, set $w_H=w_L$) for each effort level. Informally, explain the intuition for this result.

...

(b) If effort is observable, which effort level should the principal implement? What is the principal's optimal wage contract?

...

(c) If effort is not observable, which effort level should the principal implement? What is the principal's optimal wage contract?

## Problem 2

Consider a cashless entrepreneur who wants to borrow and carry out the following project.If he exerts an effort level of $e_1$, he will produce an output of $z$ with probability $P_1>0$ and 0 with probability $1-P_1$. If he exerts an effort level of $e_2$ he will produce an output of $z$ with probability $P_2(P_2< P_1)$ and 0 with probability $1-P_2$. Let $c_1>0$ be the cost of effort $e_1$ for the entrepreneur and $c_2= 0$ be the cost of low effort $e_2$. A monopolistic bank with a cost of fund of $r$ offers a loan of 1 unit for a reimbursement of $z-x$ when the project is successful, where $x$ is the share of output retained by the agent. Let the entrepreneur’s utility with no project be 0. Assume $P_z < r$.

Determine the optimal loan contract of a bank which maximizes its expected profit subject to the incentive and participation constraints of the entrepreneur.

## Problem 3

Consider a monopolist producing a good of quality $q$.  The quality can be either high ($q= 1$; then, the marginal cost of production is $c_1>0$) or low ($q= 0$; then, the marginal cost is $c_0= 0$). There is a mass one of identical consumers. Each consumer’s payoff from purchasing one unit of a good with quality $q$ at price $p$ is $U=q-p$. Assume $c_1<1$ so that producing the high quality good is socially efficient.

(a) Suppose that consumers do not observe the good’s quality before purchasing it. Thetiming of the game is as follows:

i. The monopolist chooses the quality of the good;
ii. The monopolist chooses the price;
iii. Consumers observe the price (but not the quality) and decide whether to buy (one unit of) the good.

Find a pure-strategy PBE of the game.

...

(b) Suppose now that a proportion $\alpha$ of the consumers can observe the good’s quality before purchasing it. The remaining $1 - \alpha$ consumers observe product quality only after the purchase.  The timing of the game is modified in the third stage: the informed consumers observe $q$ and the price and decide whether to buy the good, while the uninformed consumers only observe the price and decide whether to buy. Find a pure-strategy equilibrium of the game, in which all consumers buy a high-quality good.
