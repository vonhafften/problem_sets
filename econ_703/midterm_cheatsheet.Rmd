### Lecture 1

Methods of proof: direct, contradiction, contraposition, induction.

Set operations ($A, B \subset X$):

- Union: $A \cup B = \{x|x \in A$ or $x\in B\}$
- Intersection: $A \cap B = \{x|x \in A$ and $x\in B\}$ 
- Difference: $A \setminus B = \{x \in A | x \notin B\}$ 
- Complement: $A^C=\{x \in X|x\notin A\}$

DeMorgan's Laws: $(A \cap B)^C=A^C \cup B^C$ and $(A \cup B)^C=A^C \cap B^C$.

Cardinality is the size of the set.  Sets $A$ and $B$ are numerically equivalent (have the same cardinality) if their elements can be uniquely matched up and paired off.

Set $A$ is finite if it is numerically equivalent to ${1, ..., n}$ for some $n$. Then $A$'s cardinality $= n$. A set that is not finite is infinite.

An infinite set is either countable (it is numerically equivalent to $\N$) or uncountable.

### Lecture 2

Metric (distance) on a set $X$ is a function $d: X \times X \to \R_+$ s.t. $\forall x, y, z \in X$,

- $d(x, y) \ge 0$, with equality iff $x = y$,
- $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$,
- $d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, x)$

Metric space is a pair $(X, d)$, where $X$ is a set and $d$ is a metric on $X$.

Euclidean space $(\R^m, d_E(x, y)) = (\{(x_1, ..., x_m)|x_i \in \R, i=1, ..., m\}, \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i, y_i)^2})$.

In metric space $(X, d)$, open ball with center $x$ and radius $\varepsilon$ is $B_\varepsilon(x)=\{y \in X | d(x, y) < \varepsilon\}$.

In metric space $(X, d)$, closed ball with center $x$ and radius $\varepsilon$ is $B_\varepsilon(x)=\{y \in X | d(x, y) \le \varepsilon\}$.

Sequence in a set $X$ is a function $s: \N \to X$, which we write as $\{s_n\}$, where $s_n=s(n)$.

Sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ converges to $x \in X$ if $\forall \varepsilon>0 \exists N(\varepsilon)>0$ s.t. $\forall n > N(\varepsilon)$, $d(x_n, x) < \varepsilon$ (written as $x_n \to x$ or $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x$).

A sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ has at most one limit.

Consider a sequence $\{x_n\}$ and a rule that assigns to each $k \in \N$ a value $n_k \in \N$ s.t. $n_k < n_{k+1 }\forall k$. Then $\{x_{n_k}\}$ is called a subsequence.

If $\{x_n\}$ converges to $x$ as $n \to \infty$, then any subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ also converges to $x$ as $k \to \infty$.

A subset $S \subset X$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is bounded if $\exists x \in X, \beta \in \R$ s.t. $\forall s \in S, d(x, s) < \beta$.

Every convergent sequence in a metric space is bounded.

In $(\R, d_E)$, if $x_n \to x \in \R, y_n \to y \in \R$, and $x_n \le y_n \forall n \in \N$, then $x \le y$ (limits preserve weak inequality).

In $(\R, d_E)$, if $x_n \to x \in \R$ and $y_n \to y \in \R$, then $x_n + y_n \to x + y$, $x_n - y_n \to x - y$, $x_ny_n \to xy$, and $x_n/y_n \to x/y$ if $y \neq 0$ and $y_n \neq 0 \forall n$ (limits preserve algebraic operations).

Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem: Every bounded real sequence contains at least one convergent subsequence.

Monotone Convergence Theorem: Every increasing sequence of real numbers that is bounded above converges. Every decreasing sequence of real numbers that is bounded below converges.

Every real sequence contains either a decreasing subsequence or increasing subsequence (and possibly both).

Given a real sequence $\{x_n\}$, the infinite sum of its terms is well-defined if the sequence of partial sums $\{S_n\}$ converges, $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.  If $S_n \to S$, we write $\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i = S$.

### Lecture 3

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. A set $A \subset X$ is \textbf{open} if $\forall x \in A \exists \varepsilon > 0$ s.t. $B_\varepsilon \subset A$.

A set $C \subset X$ is \textbf{closed} id its complement, $C^c = X \setminus C$, is open.

Open ball $B_\varepsilon(x)$ is an open set. Closed ball $B_\varepsilon[x]$ is a closed set.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Then 

- $\emptyset$ and $X$ are simultaneously open and closed in $X$, 
- the union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open,
- the intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open,
- the union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed, 
- the intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed.

A set $A$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is closed iff every convergent sequence $\{x_n\}$ contained in $A$ has its limit in $A$.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $A$ a set in $X$. A point $x_L \in X$ is a \textbf{limit point} of A if $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, $(B_\varepsilon(x_L)\setminus\{x_l\}) \cap A \neq \emptyset$. ($A$ has points that are arbitrarily close to $x_L$)

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $A \subset X$, $f:A \to Y$, $x^0 = $ limit point of $A$.  A function $f$ has a limit $y^0$ as $x$ approaches $x^0$ if $\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. if $x \in A$ and $0 < d(x, x^0) < \delta$, then $\rho(f(X), y^0) < \varepsilon$ (written as $\lim_{x \to x^0} f(x) = y^0$).

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f:X \to Y$, $x^0 = $ limit point of $X$. Then $\lim_{x \to x^0} f(x) = y^0$ iff for any sequence $\{x_n\} \in X$ s.t. $x_n \to x^0$ and $x_n \neq x^0$, the sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges to $y^0$.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f:X \to Y$, $x^0 = $ limit point of $X$. Then the limit of $f$ as $x \to x^0$, when it exists, is unique.

### Lecture 4

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces. A function $f: X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous} at a point $x^0$ if $\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. if $d(x, x^0) < \delta$, then $\rho(f(x), f(x^0)) < \varepsilon$.

\textbf{Continuity at} $x^0$ requires $f(x^0)$ is defined and either $x^0$ is an isolated point of $X$ ($\exists x^0$ s.t. $B_\varepsilon(x^0) = \{x^0\}$) or $\lim_{x \to x^0} f(x)$ exists and equals $f(x^0)$.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f: X \to Y$. Then $f$ is continuous at $x^0$ iff either (1) $f(x)$ is defined and either $x^0$ is an isolated point or $x^0$ is a limit point of $X$ and $\lim_{x \to x^0} = f(X^0)$ or (2) for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ s.t. $x_n \to x^0$, the sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ converges to $f(x^0)$.

A function $f$ is continuous if it is continuous at every point of its domain.

$f^{-1}(A) = \{x \in X|f(x) \to A\}$

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f:x \to Y$. Then $f$ is continuous iff for any closed set $C$ in $(Y, \rho)$, the set $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $(X, d)$.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f:x \to Y$. Then $f$ is continuous iff for any open set $C$ in $(Y, \rho)$, the set $f^{-1}(C)$ is open in $(X, d)$.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces. A function $f:X \to Y$ is uniformly continuous if $\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. if $d(x, x^0) < \delta$, then $\rho(f(x), f(x^0)) < \varepsilon$ ($\delta$ depends only on $\varepsilon$ not on $x^0$).

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f: X \to Y, E \subset X$. Then $f$ is Lipschitz on $E$ if $\exists K > 0$ s.t. $\rho(f(x), f(y)) \le K d(x, y) \forall x,y \in E$.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be two metric spaces, $f: X \to Y, E \subset X$. Then $f$ is locally Lipschitz on $E$ if $\forall x \in E \exists \varepsilon > 0$ s.t. $f$ is Lipschitz on $B_\varepsilon(x) \cap E$.

Lipschitz continuity $\implies$ uniform continuity $\implies$ continuity

### Lecture 5

Let $X \subset \R$. Then $u \in \R$ is an upper bound for $X$ if $x\le u$ for all $x\in X$.

Let $X \subset \R$. Then $l \in \R$ is an lower bound for $X$ if $x \ge l$ for all $x\in X$.

Suppose $X$ is bounded above. The \textbf{supremum} of $X$, $\sup X$, is the smallest upper bound for $X$. That is, $\sup X$ satisfies $\sup X \ge x \forall x \in X$ and $\forall y < \sup X \exists x \in X$ s.t. $x>y$.

Suppose $X$ is bounded below. The \textbf{infimum} of $X$, $\inf X$, is the largest lower bound for $X$. That is, $\inf X$ satisfies $\inf X \le x \forall x \in X$ and $\forall y > \inf X \exists x \in X$ s.t. $x<y$.

\textbf{Supremum Property:} Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a supremum.  This supremum is a real number.

\textbf{EVT:} Let $f:[a, b] \to \R$ be a continuous function. Then $f$ attains its maximum and minimum on $[a, b]$: $f(x_M)=\sup_{x \in [a, b]} f(x), f(x_m) = inf_{x \in [a, b]}f(x), x_M, x_m \in [a, b]$.

\textbf{IVT:} Let $f:[a, b] \to \R$ be a continuous function. Then for any $\gamma \in [f(a), f(b)]$ there exists $c \in [a, b]$ s.t. $f(c) = \gamma$.

$f: \R \to \R$ is monotonically increasing if $\forall x, y, x < y$ implies $f(x) < f(y)$.

Let $f:(a, b) \to \R$ be monotonically increasing. Then one-sided limits $f(x^+):= \lim_{x \to x^+} f(y)$ and $f(x^-):= \lim_{x \to x^-} f(y)$ exist $\forall x \in (a, b)$.  Moreover, $\sup\{f(s)|a<s<x\} = f(x^-) \le f(x) \le f(x^+)= \inf\{f(s)|x < s < b\}$.

### Lecture 6

A sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is \textbf{Cauchy} if $\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists N > 0$ s.t. if $m, n > N$, then $d(x_n, x_m) < \varepsilon$.

Every \textbf{convergent} sequence in a metric space is \textbf{Cauchy}.

A metric space $(X, d)$ is \textbf{complete} if every Cauchy sequence contained in $X$ converges to some point in $X$.

Euclidean space $(\R^m, d_E)$ is complete for any $m$.

If $(X, d)$ is a complete metric space and $Y \subset X$, then $(Y, d)$ is complete iff $Y$ is closed.

A function $T: X \to X$ from a metric space to itself is called and \textbf{operator}.

An operator $T: X \to X$ is a \textbf{contraction of modulus $\beta$} if $\beta < 1$ and $d(T(x), T(y)) \le \beta d(x, y) \forall x, y \in X$.

Every contraction is uniformly continuous.

A fixed point of an operator $T$ is an element $x^* \in X$ s.t. $T(x^*) = x^*$.

\textbf{Contraction Mapping Theorem:} Let $(X, d)$ be a nonempty complete metric space and $T:X \to X$ a contraction with modulus $\beta < 1$.  Then $T$ has a unique fixed point $x^*$ and $\forall x_0 \in X$ the sequence $\{x_n\}$, where $x_n = T^n(x_0)=T(T(...T(x_0)))$ converges to $x^*$.

\textbf{Continuous Dependence of the Fixed Point on Parameters}: Let $(X, d)$ and $(\Omega, \rho)$ be two metric spaces and $T: X \times \Omega \to X$.  For each $\omega \in \Omega$, let $T_\omega:X \to X$ be defined by $T_\omega(x) = T(x, \omega)$. Suppose $(X, d)$ is complete, $T$ is continuous in $\omega$, and $\exists \beta < 1$ s.t. $T_\omega$ is a contraction of modulus $\beta$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$.  Then the fixed point function $x^*: \Omega \to X$ defined by $x^*(\omega)=T_\omega(x^*(\omega))$ is continuous.

\textbf{Blackwell's Sufficient Conditions:} Let $B(X)$ be the set of all bounded functions from $X$ to $\R$ with metric $d_\infty(f, g) = \sup_{x \in X}|f(x) - g(x)|$. Let $T:B(X) \to B(X)$ satisfy monotonicity (if $f(x) \le g(x) \forall x \in X$, then $(T(f))(x)\le (T(g))(x)$ for all $x \in X$) and discounting ($\exists \beta \in (0, 1)$ s.t. for every $\alpha \ge 0$ and $x \in X$, $(T(f+a))(x) \le (T(f))(x) + \beta \alpha$), then $T$ is a contraction with modulus $\beta$.

### Lecture 7

A collection of sets $\mathcal{U} = \{ U_\lambda  |\lambda \in \Lambda\}$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is an \textbf{open cover} of the set $A$ if $U_\lambda$ is open for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$ and $A \subset \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} U_\lambda$.

A set $A$ in a metric space is \textbf{compact} if every open cover of $A$ contains a \textbf{finite subcover} of $A$.  That is, if $\{ U_\lambda | \lambda \in \Lambda\}$ is an open cover of $A$, then $\exists n \in \N$ and $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n \in \Lambda$ such that $A \subset U_{\lambda_1} \cup ... \cup U_{\lambda_n}$.

Any closed subset of a compact space is compact.

If $A$ is a compact subset of a metric space, then $A$ is closed and bounded.

Heine-Borel Theorem: If $A \subset \R^m$, then $A$ is compact iff $A$ is closed and bounded.

Closed interval $[a, b] = \{a \in \R^m | a_i \le x_i \le b_i, i=1, ..., m \}$ is compact in $(\R^m, d_E)$ for any $a, b, \in \R^m$.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be metric spaces. If $f:X \to Y$ is continuous and $C$ is a compact set in $(X, d)$, then $f(C)$ is compact in $(Y, \rho)$.

EVT: If $C$ is a compact set in a metric space $(X, d)$ and $f:C \to \R$ is continuous, then $f$ is bounded on $C$ and attains its maximum and minimum.

Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, \rho)$ be metric spaces, $C \subset X$ compact, $f:C \to Y$ continuous.  Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $C$. 

### Lecture 8

A \textbf{vector space} $V$ is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied by real numbers, called scalars, satisfying $\forall x, y, z \in V$, $\forall \alpha, \beta \in \R$: 

- $(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)$, 
- $x+y=y+x$, 
- $\exists \bar{0} \in V$ s.t. $x + \bar{0} = \bar{0} + x = x$, 
- $\exists (-x) \in V$ s.t. $x + (-x)=\bar{0}$, 
- $\alpha(x+y)=\alpha x + \alpha y$, 
- $(\alpha + \beta) x = \alpha x + \beta x$, 
- $(\alpha \cdot \beta)x = \alpha (\beta \cdot x)$, 
- $1 \cdot x = x$.
