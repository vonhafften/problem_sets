# Question 1. Rationalizing Demand

Suppose you observe the following data on prices, wealth, and chosen consumption bundles for a certain consumer at four points in time:

+-----+-----------+-------------+
| $w$ | $p$       | $x$         |
+-----+-----------+-------------+
| 100 | (5, 5, 5) | (12, 4, 4)  |
+-----+-----------+-------------+
| 100 | (7, 4, 5) | (9, 3, 5)   |
+-----+-----------+-------------+
| 100 | (2, 4, 1) | (27, 9, 10) |
+-----+-----------+-------------+
| 150 | (7, 4, 5) | (15, 5, 5)  |
+-----+-----------+-------------+

(a) Are the data consistent with Walras Law?

Yes.

\begin{align*}
(5, 5, 5) \cdot (12, 4, 4) &= 100\\
(7, 4, 5) \cdot (9, 3, 5) &= 100\\
(2, 4, 1) \cdot (27, 9, 10) &= 100\\
(7, 4, 5) \cdot (15, 5, 5) &= 150
\end{align*}

(b) Can these data be rationalized by a continuous, monotonic and concave utility function?\footnote{Hint: you don't need to calculate the cost of every bundle at every price; if $x^i > x^j$, then $p \cdot x^i > p \cdot x^j$ for any $p >> 0$.}

By Afriat's Theorem, we know that if data satisfy GARP, then there exists a LNS, continuous, concave, monotonic utility function that rationalizes the data.

  - Consider $x^1$ and $x^2$.  $x^1 \cdot p^1 = (12, 4, 4) \cdot (5, 5, 5) = 100$ and $x^2 \cdot p^1 = (9, 3, 5) \cdot (5, 5, 5) = 85$.  So $x^1 \succ^D x^2$.

  - Consider $x^1$ and $x^3$. Notice $x^3>x^1$. By the hint, $p \cdot x^3 > p \cdot x^1$ for any $p >> 0$. So $x^3 \succ^D x^1$.

  - Consider $x^1$ and $x^4$. Notice $x^4>x^1$. By the hint, $x^4 \succ^D x^1$.

  - Consider $x^2$ and $x^3$. Notice $x^3>x^2$. By the hint, $x^3 \succ^D x^2$.

  - Consider $x^2$ and $x^4$. Notice $x^4 > x^2$. By the hint, $x^4 \succ^D x^2$.

  - Consider $x^3$ and $x^4$. Notice $x^3 > x^4$. By the hint, $x^3 \succ^D x^4$.

Thus, $x^3 \succ^D x^4 \succ^D x^1 \succ^D x^2$.  The data satisfy GARP.

# Question 2. Aggregating Demand

Suppose there are $n$ consumers, and consumer $i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ has indirect utility function $v^i = a_i(p) + b(p)w_i$ where $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $b$ are differentiable functions from $\R_+^k$ to $\R$.

(a) Use Roy's Identity to calculate each consumer's Marshallian demand $x^i(p, w_i)$.

Since $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $b$ are differentiable, $v^i$ is differentiable. 

$$
\frac{\partial v^i}{\partial w_i} = b(p)
$$

$$
\frac{ \partial v^i }{\partial p} = \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial p}w_i
$$

By Roy's Identity,

$$
x^i(p, w_i) = - \frac{  \partial v^i /\partial p}{\partial v/\partial w_i} = -\frac{\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial p}w_i}{b(p)}
$$

(b) Calculate the Marshallian demand $X(p, W)$ of a "representative consumer" with wealth $W$ and indirect utility function $V(p, W) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i(p) + b(p)W$ show that $X(p, \sum_{i=1}^n w_i) = \sum_{i=1}^nx^i(p, w_i)$.

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial W} = b(p)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial p} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial p}W
$$

By Roy's identity,

$$
X(p, W) = -\frac{  \partial V /\partial p}{\partial V/\partial W} = -\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial p}W}{b(p)}
$$

$$
X(p, \sum_{i=1}^n w_i) 
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a'_i(p) + b'(p)\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}{b(p)}\\
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n [a'_i(p) + b'(p)w_i]}{b(p)}\\
= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a'_i(p) + b'(p)w_i}{b(p)}\\
= \sum_{i=1}^n x^i(p, w_i)
$$

# Question 3. Homothetic Preferences

Complete, transitive preferences $\succsim$ on $\R^k_+$ are called homothetic if for all $x, y \in \R^k_+$ and all $t > 0$, $x \succsim y \iff tx \succsim ty$.

(a) Show that if preferences are homothetic, Marhallian demand is homogeneous of degree 1 in wealth: for any $t > 0, x(p, tw) = tx(p, w)$.

(b) Show that if preferences are homothetic, monotone, and continuous, they can be represented by a utility function which is homogeneous of degree 1. (Hint try the utility function we used to prove existsnce of a utility function in class.)

(c) Show that given (a) and (b), the indirect utility function takes he form $v(p, w) = b(p)w$ for some function $b$.

# Question 4. Quasilinear Utility

Let $X = \R \times \R^{k-1}_+$ (allow positive or negative consumption of the first good), suppose utility $u(x) = x_1 + U(x_2, ..., x_k)$ is quasilinear, and fix the price of the first good $p_1=1$.

(a) Show that Marshallian demand for goods 2 through $k$ does not depend on wealth.

(b) Show that indirect utility can be written as $v(p, w) = w + \tilde{v}(p)$ for some function $\tilde{v}$.

(c) Show the expenditure function can be written as $e(p, u) = u - f(p)$ for some function $f$.

(d) Show that the Hicksian demand for goods 2 through $k$ does not depend on target utility.

(e) Show that Compensating Variation and Equivalent Variation are the same when the price of good $i \neq 1$ changes, and also equal to Consumer Surplus.
