# Question 1. Convex production sets, concave production functions, convex costs

Consider a production function $f : \R^m_+ \to \R_+$ for a single-output firm.

(a) Prove that if the production set $Y = \{(q, -z) : f(z) \ge q\} \subset \R^{m+1}$ is convex, the production function $f$ is concave.

Proof: 

(b) Prove that if $f$ concave, the cost function

$$
c(q, w) = \min w \cdot z \text{ subject to } f(z) \ge q
$$

is convex in $q$.

Proof:

# Question 2. Solving for the profit function given technology...

Let $k=2$, and let the production set be

$$
Y = \{(y_1, y_2) : y_1 \le 0 \text{ and } y_2 \le B(-y_1)^{\frac{2}{3}}\}
$$

where $B > 0$ is a known constant.  Assume both prices are strictly positive.

(a) Draw $Y$, or describe it clearly.

(b) Solve the firm's profit maximization problem to find $\pi(p)$ and $Y^*(p)$. (It may help to set $z=-y_1$ as the amount of input used, explain why a profit-maximizing firm will set )
