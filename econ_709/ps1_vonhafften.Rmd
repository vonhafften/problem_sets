(1) For two events $A, B \in S$, prove that $A \cup B = (A \cap B) \cup ((A \cap B^C)\cup(B \cap A^C))$.

(2) Prove that $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.

(3) Suppose that the unconditional probability of a disease is 0.0025.  A screening test for this disease has a detection rate of 0.9, and has a false positive rate of 0.01.  Given that the screening test returns positive, what is the conditional probability of having the disease?

(4) Suppose that a pair of events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, i.e., $A \cap B = \emptyset$, and that $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B)>0$.  Prove that $A$ and $B$ are not independent.

(5) (Conditional Independence) Sometimes, we may also use the concept of conditional independence.  The definition is as follows: let $A, B, C$ be three events with positive probabilities. Then $A$ and $B$ are independent given $C$ if $P(A \cap B | C)=P(A|C) P(B|C)$. Consider the experiment of tossing two dice.  Let $A =$ {First die is 6}, $B =$ {Second die is 6}, and $C =$ {Both dice are the same}.

(a) Show that $A$ and $B$ are independent (unconditionally), but $A$ and $B$ are dependent given $C$.

(b) Consider the following experiment: let there be two urns, one with 9 black balls and 1 white balls and the other with 1 black ball and 9 white balls.  First randomly (with equal probability) select one urn.  Then take two draws with replacement from the selected urn.  Let $A$ and $B$ be drawing a black ball in the first and the second draw, respectively, and let $C$ be the event urn 1 is selected. Show that $A$ and $B$ are not independent, but are conditionally independent given $C$.

(6) A CDF $F_X$ is stochastically greater than a CDF $F_Y$ if $F_X(t) \le F_Y(t)$ for all $t$ and $F_X(t) < F_Y(t)$ for some $t$.  Prove that if $X \sim F_X$ and $Y \sim F_Y$, then 

$$
P(X > t) \ge P(Y > t) \text{ for every }t,
$$

|        and 

$$
P(X > t) > P(Y > t) \text{ for some }t,
$$

|        that is, $X$ tends to be bigger than $Y$.

(7) Show that the function $F_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & x <0 \\ 1-\exp(-x),  & x \ge 0\end{cases}$ is a CDF, and $f_X(x)$ and $F^{-1}_X(y)$.
