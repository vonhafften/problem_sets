1. Consider the following overlapping generations problem. In each period $t = 1, 2, 3, ...$ a new generation of 2 period lived households are born.  Each generation has a unitary mass.  There is a unit measure of initial old who are endowed with $\bar{M} > 0$ units of fiat money. Each generation is endowed with $w_1$ in youth and $w_2$ in old age of non-storable consumption goods where $w_1 > w_2$.  There is no commitment technology to enforce trades. The utility function of a household of generation $t \ge 1$ is $U(c_t^t, c_{t+1}^t) = \ln(c_t^t) + \ln(c_{t+1}^t)$ where $(c_t^t, c_{t+1}^t)$ is consumption of a household of generation $t$ in youth (i.e., in period $t$) and old age (i.e., in period $t+1$).  The preference of the initial old are given by $U(c_1^0) = \ln(c_1^0)$ where $c_1^0$ is consumption by a household of the initial old.

(a) State and solve the planner problem.

In any period $t$, the social planner weights agents alive equally and optimally allocates resources between them given preferences and technologies:

\begin{align*}
\max_{(c_t^t, c_t^{t-1}) \in \R^2_+} & \ln(c_t^t) + \ln(c_{t}^{t-1})\\
\text{s.t. } & c_t^t + c_t^{t-1}\le w_1 + w_2
\end{align*}

Since utility is strictly increasing in consumption, we know that the maximum will occur at $c_t^t + c_t^{t-1} = w_1 + w_2 \implies c_t^{t-1} = w_1 + w_2 - c_t^t$. Thus, we can write the social planner's problem as an unconstrained maximization problem:

$$
\max_{c_t^t \in \R_+} \ln(c_t^t) + \ln(w_1 + w_2 - c_t^t)
$$

Setting the first order condition to zero:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{c_t^t} - \frac{1}{w_1 + w_2 - c_t^t} &= 0\\
\implies c_t^t  &= \frac{w_1 + w_2}{2}
\end{align*}

Plugging the solution into the equation for the consumption of old agents:

\begin{align*}
c_t^{t-1} &= w_1 + w_2 - \frac{w_1 + w_2}{2} \\
  &= \frac{w_1 + w_2}{2} \\
\end{align*}

(b) State the representative household's problem in period $t \ge 0$. Try to write the budget constraints in real terms.

I break the household problem into the problem facing an initial old agent and the problem facing agents born in period $t > 0$.  Let $p_t$ be the number of dollar per unit of consumption good in period $t$.  Define $m_{t+1}^t \in \R_+$ as the monetary holdings of the generation born in $t$ between periods $t$ and $t+1$.

The problem facing the initial old agents is:

\begin{align*}
\max_{c_1^0 \in \R_+} & \ln(c_1^0) \\
\text{s.t. } & c_1^0 \le w_2 + \frac{\bar{M}}{p_1}
\end{align*}

The problem facing agents born in period $t > 0$ is:

\begin{align*}
\max_{(c_t^t, c_{t+1}^t) \in \R^2_+} & \ln(c_t^t) + \ln(c_{t+1}^{t})\\
\text{s.t. } & c_t^t \le w_1 - \frac{m_{t+1}^t}{p_t}\\ 
             & c_{t+1}^t \le w_2 + \frac{m_{t+1}^t}{p_{t+1}} 
\end{align*}

(c) Define and solve for an autarkic equilibrium, assuming that it exists.

(d) Define and solve for a competitive equilibrium assuming valued money but with $w_2=0$.

(e) Compare the solutions to the plannners problem, the autarky equilibrium and the stationary monetary competitive equilibrium with valued money, all with $w_2 = 0$.

(f) What happens to consumption, money demand and prices in a competitive equilibrium with valued money if the initial money supply is halved, i.e. $\bar{M}' = \frac{\bar{M}}{2}$. Keep the assumption that $w_2 = 0$.

2. Plot the trade offer curves for the following utility functinos where the endowment is $(w_1, w_2)$ for goods 1 and 2, respectively.

(a) $U=10c_1-4c_1^2+4c_2-c_2^2, (w1, w_2) = (0, 2)$

(b) $U = \min{2c_1 + c_2, c_1 + 2c_2}, (w1, w_2) = (1, 0)$

(c) $U = \min{2c_1 + c_2, c_1 + 2c_2}, (w1, w_2) = (1, 10)$
